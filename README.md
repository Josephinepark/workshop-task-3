[] collect a series of images. Make a p5.js sketch that generates a new collage each time the sketch is run.<br>

## Process and Experimentation

At first, my code was not working so I looked at it step by step and looked at where there was a problem. The problem was that I had the different names with the variables. (img -> imgs)<br>
